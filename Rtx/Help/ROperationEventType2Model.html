<h1>Operation Event Type 2</h1>


<h2>Class Name</h2>

<ul>
	<li>ROperationEventType2Model</li>
</ul>


<h2>Location in Objects Pane</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Models > Model > Event > Operation Type 2</li>
</ul>


<h2>Model Description</h2>

<h3>Model Form</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This model schedules the events of conducting an operation for different operators.</li>
	<b>Note:</b> In this model, there are several operators with different capacities and there is only one demand parameter.<br>


</ul>

<h3>DDM sensitivities</h3>
<ul>
	<li>No</li>
</ul>


<h2>Properties</h2>
<h3 id="ObjectName">Object Name</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Name of the object in Rt</li>
	<li>Allowable characters are upper-case and lower-case letters, numbers, and underscore (&ldquo;_&rdquo;).</li>
	<li>The name is unique and case-sensitive.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="DisplayOutput">Display Output</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Determines whether the model is allowed to print messages to the Output Pane.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="TimeParameter">Time Parameter</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Time object</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="NewOperationDemand">New Operation Demand</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The demand for the operation, in terms of the number of the components which needs the operation.</li>
	<li>This parameter must address the new demand, i.e. the demand that has just been added.</li>
	
</ul>

<h3 id="OperationCapacityList">Operation Capacity List</h3>
<ul>
	<li>List of the capacity of different operators for conducting the operation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="OperationTimeList">Operation Time List</h3>
<ul>
	<li>List of the duration of conducting the operation for different operators</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="OperationFinishStatusList">Operation Finish Status List</h3>
<ul>
	<li>List of the status parameters of the operation for different components. This parameter addresses the number of the operations that has completed by each operator.</li>
	<li>Note: once the operaion is completed by an operator for \({k}\) unit of damand, the status parameter of that operator is increased by \({k}\).
</ul>

<h3 id="PriorityRule ">Priority Rule </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Method of prioritizating the operators for conducting the operation</li>
	<li>The &ldquo;In Order Of Input&rdquo; option schedules the events based on the order of the operators input by the user, on a first come first served basis</li>
	<li>The &ldquo;In Order Of Importance&rdquo; option schedules the events based on the order of importance of operators. Note that, if this option is selected, the list of the importance measure of all operators must be input in the &ldquo;Importance Measure List&rdquo; property.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ImportanceMeasureList">Importance Measure List</h3>
<ul>
	<li>List of the importance measure of all operators.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="NumberOfPrerequisiteOperations">Number Of Prerequisite Operations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The number of operations that have to be finished before the current operation can start (Finish-to-Start prerequisite)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="PrerequisiteOperationsFinishStatusList">Prerequisite Operations Finish Status List</h3>
<ul>

	<li>List of the status of the prerequisite operations of the current operation for differnet operators (1 if finished, 0 otherwise). The size of this list must be equal to the number of prerequisite operations times the number of the operators. </li>
	<li><b>Note:</b> First, the status parameters of the first prerequisite operation for all operators are input. Next, the status parameters of the second prerequisite operation for all operators are input. This procedure continues untill all of the prerequisite operations of all operators are input.  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Output</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This model does not generate response objects.</li>
	<li>It provides the scheduled events to the orchestrating algorithm.</li>
</ul>	
<h2>Right-click Menu</h2>

<h3 id="Remove">Remove</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removes the object.</li>
</ul>
